<h1>Aniruddh Anand Personal Website</h1>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
Hi! I'm Ani a student at The University of Texas at Austin in the CSB Honors
Program. I am not a big fan of personal websites because they all seem to be the
same react/next.js templates over and over again ... and i am pretty bad at
website design. I prefer spending my time either working on personal projects or
enjoying the world.

<h2>Experience:</h2>
<p>- Firmware Engineer @ Apple</p>
<p>- Data Engineer @ StateFarm</p>
<p>- Operating Systems Researcher @ UT Austin</p>
<p>- Undergraduate TA @ UT Austin</p>

<h2>Interests:</h2>
<p>I like computer architecture, systems, and distributed systems!
Oh also a big nba fan, I used to watch anime, but nowadays read more light
novels and korean web novels.</p>

I have also been getting into reading and understanding संस्कृतम्.

<h2>Current Projects:</h2>
<p>- I am writting my own arm based kernel in C and risk-v processor in verilog</p>
<p>- Also Recomendations are always welcome</p>
<p>- This website too is a ongoing project. I will try to update it as I go. If
you find the github page for this feel free to witness the greating piece of
html trash!</p>

<h2>Contact:</h2>
<p>*This is super cool in my opinion replacing the dots and ats so the bots don't
spam you*</p>
